## What is this for?

Given a number n of boards passed as arguments in which there are empty and obstacle characters, the program gets the biggest square possible that can fit at the board avoiding all obstacles. If there’s more than 1 possible square, the program chooses the one on the top left.

For example, given the next board:

```
...........................
....o......................
............o..............
...........................
....o......................
...............o...........
...........................
......o..............o.....
..o.......o................
```

The program should return:

```
.....xxxxxxx...............
....oxxxxxxx...............
.....xxxxxxxo..............
.....xxxxxxx...............
....oxxxxxxx...............
.....xxxxxxx...o...........
.....xxxxxxx...............
......o..............o.....
..o.......o................
```

If there’s any error while opening the board or it is wrongly designed, the program return the message `map error`

## Board structure

The board has a first line with the following elements:

- The number of rows of the board
- The empty character
- The full character
- The obstacle character

After this first line is the board itself.

Example:

```
9.ox
...........................
....o......................
............o..............
...........................
....o......................
...............o...........
...........................
......o..............o.....
..o.......o................
```

## Board generator

If you want to test the program with different boards, you can generate boards automatically with the file `boards.pl` . Just type the instruction:

```bash
./extra/boards.pl X Y D
```

where **X** means the number of columns, **Y** the number of rows and **D** the obstacles density.
